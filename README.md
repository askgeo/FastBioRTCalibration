# FastBioRTCalibration
### An Rmd workflow for fast manual BioRT Calibration. (WIP)

This R Markdown script will take in your:
<br>
<br>1. measured stream chemistry data for one solute
<br>2. Working directory path
<br>3. BioRT input folder name
With the Run All command, you can run BioRT and view results and NSE for most recent two runs with one command.
### Feature wishlist:
1. <s>streamlined first run</s>
3. code generalized to any solute
4. Python version
5. Version with in-script parameter changes
6. **Shiny dashboard version**
