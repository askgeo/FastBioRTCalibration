# FastBioRTCalibration
### An R workflow for fast manual BioRT Calibration. (WIP)

This script will take in your:
<br>
<br>1. measured stream chemistry data for one solute
<br>2. Working directory path
<br>3. BioRT input folder name

and after one run to set things up, and commenting out the setup section, you can run BioRT and view results and NSE for most recent two runs with one command.

### Feature wishlist:
1. streamlined first run
3. code generalized to any solute
4. **Shiny dashboard version**
5. Python version
